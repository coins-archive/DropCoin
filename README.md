=================================================

DropCoin (DCO) is an open-source cryptocurrency project. A new form of social media marketing is created via the use of branded promotional coin airdrops. DropCoin intends to provide its partners and users with the ability to create and disperse promotional coins through an airdorp platform. Promotional coins will be given as the reward for the completion of campaign-specific objectives.
