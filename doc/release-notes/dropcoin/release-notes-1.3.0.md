How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/DropCoin-Qt (on Mac) or dropcoind/dropcoin-qt (on Linux).

Compatibility
==============

DropCoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
Linux, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and later.
